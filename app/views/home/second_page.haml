      %p{:style => "font-size: 16px;"} In an emergency medical situation, when lives may hang in the balance, the last thing you want to do is waste time finding supplies, personnel, and mobile or permanent treatment facilities. With Resource Map, you can quickly locate and manage critical resources on a real-time map using a computer or smartphone. On an emergency scene, when you might not have access to computers or smartphones, you and your team can view and update resource allocations with any phone capable of text messaging.

      %p{:style => "font-size: 16px;"} Medicine is at its best when it helps people avoid illness in the first place. Resource Map aids prevention efforts by giving teams new ways to manage key supply chain items, such as vaccines, vitamins, and other disease prevention tools. And by uploading statistics on various measures of health, you can even use Resource Map to monitor the effectiveness of your interventions. After all, a healthy community is one of your most important resources.

      %h1 How does it work?
      %p{:style => "font-size: 16px;"} Getting started with Resource Map is simple. Just enter resource allocation data manually or upload an existing spreadsheet containing the data. Once your data is online, it's easy to keep tabs on resources visually, on a real-time map, using any computer or smartphone. Even better, field teams can receive alerts, update resource deployment, and query resource status using any phone that can send and receive text messages, in addition to using a computer or smartphone. If you can get a cell phone signal, you can view and manage resources with Resource Map.

      %p{:style => "font-size: 16px;"}
        With the support of the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), CNM uses Resource Map to support their malaria drug program with our tool to capture malaria drug updates from at risk health centers on a two week cycle. The goal of monitoring resources so closely is to improve the stock management of malaria treatment drugs. This tool helps the health centers to avoid the possibility of over or under stocking important drug supplies.

        With the support from the Global Fund, the Center for Malaria Parasitology and Entomology of Laos PDR (CMPE) uses Resource Map to report both the stock levels of life saving malaria drugs and the number of Malaria cases located at the village health centers up to the national level. Â This allows the Ministry of Health to have a real time visual picture of what resources are available and what is needed to treat patients.
